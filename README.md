📊 Task 1: Interactive E-Commerce Sales Dashboard in Power BI
What a great way to kick off my internship journey! For Task 1, I worked with real-world e-commerce data — over 1 million transactions across two years — to build a fully functional and insight-driven Business Sales Dashboard using Power BI.

🔍 Task Objective:
This hands-on simulation aimed to help business stakeholders answer key questions:

Which products are top-selling by quantity and revenue?

When do sales peak across months and years?

Which countries contribute most to total revenue?

🚀 What I Accomplished:
Cleaned and structured 1M+ rows of raw retail data using Power Query

Merged and prepared datasets from 2009–10 and 2010–11 for analysis

Built custom DAX measures for Total Revenue, Orders, Unique Customers, AOV, and KPIs

Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with filters for Year, Country, and Product

📊 Dashboard Highlights:
KPI Cards: Revenue, Orders, AOV, Quantity

Time Series Trends: Monthly and yearly revenue/order tracking

Top Products: Visuals for top 5 by revenue and quantity

Geographical Insights: Country-wise sales via Donut and Map charts

Performance Gauges: Revenue vs Target, Orders vs Target

Customer Segmentation: Insights on repeat vs new buyers

Fun Fact: Best-selling product — "WORLD WAR 2 GLIDERS ASSTD DESIGNS"

🧠 Skills I’m Building:
Power Query for data cleaning and merging

Time-based trend analysis and KPI tracking

DAX for custom calculations

Business storytelling through visuals

Interactive dashboard design in Power BI

🛠️ Tools Used:
Power BI Desktop

Microsoft Excel

This dashboard isn’t just a set of visuals — it’s a complete decision-support system. Looking forward to diving deeper into the next challenge in this data-driven internship!
